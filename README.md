# Emby.Plugins.Gotify
Gotify notifications for your Emby Server, certified working on `4.5.2.0`

## Installation

Download the latest DLL file on the release page of this repo, put it in the "plugins" folder of your Emby Server and restart Emby Server.
The plugin should now show up in your Emby Server management page under Advanced > Plugins.

## Credits

This is just a slight mod of the Pushover plugin for Emby Server written by [LukePulverenti](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Pushover)
so all thanks to him and the Emby Server team. I take no credits for this.

And of course big thanks to [Gotify](https://gotify.net) as well.
